# FIFA Ranking:
> [!WARNING]
> We are not the official FIFA ranking website and are not affiliated with them in any way. We are simply a website that calculates and predicts the points of national teams in the FIFA world rankings for upcoming updates before they are released on the official FIFA website

## How do we calculate:
We use the Elo System adopted by FIFA since 2018, and it is as follows:

P = PBefore + I x (W - WE)

- **P = Points after calculation**
- **PBefore: Points before calculation**

- **I = Match type:**
```
Friendly matches played outside of International Match Calendar windows : 5
```

```
 - Friendly matches played during International Match Calendar windows: 10
```

```
 - Group phase matches of Nations League competitions: 15
```

```
 - Play-off and final matches of Nations League competitions: 25
```
